# Step 9: Implement interactive methods:
# - talk(): pet says a random word, triggers clock tick, shows mood, saves game
# - feed(): reduce hunger by random amount, triggers clock tick, shows mood, saves
# - sleep(): increase energy by random amount, triggers clock tick, shows mood, saves
# - play(): decrease energy, increase hunger, triggers clock tick, shows mood, saves
# - teach(word): add new word to vocab if not known, reduce energy, triggers clock tick, shows mood, saves

# Step 10: Implement show_status() to print all pet stats and mood

# Step 11: Implement save() method to write pet data to JSON file

# Step 12: Implement load() class method to load pet data from JSON file or return None

# Step 13: Implement loading_screen() function to simulate loading animation on startup

# Step 14: Implement main() function to:
# - Load existing pet or create new pet
# - Greet user
# - Loop showing status and interaction menu
# - Accept user input and call corresponding pet methods
# - Handle quitting and saving
# - Catch pet death exception and exit gracefully

# Step 15: Add if __name__ == "__main__" to run main()
